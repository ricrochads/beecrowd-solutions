# 3302 - Correct Answer

Roumes was an above average student. In math tests, he always got a maximum score, getting all the maths right, but his secret wasn't in doing the math correctly. He interpreted what he saw in the environment around him and he could deduce the answers to the questions. You too can be someone special, just like Roumes.

**Input**<br>
Input consists of several test cases. Each case contains a number **N**, representing the number of questions. The next **N** lines show what you saw to get to the answer.

**Output**<br>
For each question asked, print the word 'resposta', followed by a space, then the question number, a colon, a space and the answer.
