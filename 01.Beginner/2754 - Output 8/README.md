Your teacher would like you to do a program with the following characteristics:

1. Create two real double-precision variables;
2. Assign the first the value 234.345 and the second the value 45.698;
3. Print the two variables to six decimal places;
4. Print the two variables with no decimal places;
5. Print the two variables with a decimal;
6. Print the two variables with two decimal places;
7. Print the two variables with three decimal places;
8. Print the two variables with scientific notation with 'e';
9. Print the two variables with scientific notation with 'E';
10. Print the two variables with use the shortest representation, with 'e' or 'E' or without;
11. Print the two variables with use the shortest representation, with 'e' or 'E' or without;

To print, separate the values with a space, a dash (-), and a space.
