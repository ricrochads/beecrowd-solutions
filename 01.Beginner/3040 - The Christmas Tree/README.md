# 3040 - The Christmas Tree

Every year, Roberto likes to choose his Christmas tree, he doesn't let anyone choose for him, because he thinks the tree to be beautiful, must meet some conditions, such as height, thickness and number of branches, so he can hang many Christmas decorations on it.

Roberto wants his tree to be at least 200 centimeters tall, but he doesn't want it to be larger than 300 centimeters, or the tree won't fit in his house. As for thickness, he wants his tree to have a trunk that is 50 centimeters in diameter or more. The tree must be 150 branches or greater.
