# 1146 - Growing Sequences

Your program must read an integer **X** indefinited times (the program must stop when **X** is equal to zero). For each **X** print the sequence from 1 to **X**, with one space between each one of these numbers.

PS: Be carefull. Don't leave any space after the last number of each line, otherwise you'll get *Presentation Error*.

**Input**<br>
The input file contains many integer numbers. The last one is zero.

**Output**<br>
For each number N of the input file, one output line must be printed, from 1 to N like the following example. Be careful with blank spaces after the last line number.

| Input Sample            | Output Sample                                  |
|:------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|
| 5 <br> 10 <br> 3 <br> 0 | 1 2 3 4 5 <br> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 <br> 1 2 3 |
