# 3302 - Correct Answer

Roumes was an above average student. In math tests, he always got a maximum score, getting all the maths right, but his secret wasn't in doing the math correctly. He interpreted what he saw in the environment around him and he could deduce the answers to the questions. You too can be someone special, just like Roumes.
