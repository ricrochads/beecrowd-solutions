# 3301 - Middle Nephew

Uncle Patinhas was a millionaire who lived in his mansion, and he had three nephews: Huguinho, Zezinho and Luisinho. He was easily confused between the three nephews because they were very similar, despite their different ages. One day, the three made a bet with their uncle: if he guessed who the middle nephew was, that is, neither the youngest nor the oldest, they would give him a gold coin, and if he missed, he would have to give each one a gold coin. So the uncle asks for your help so he can win this bet
