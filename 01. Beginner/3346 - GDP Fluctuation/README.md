# 3346 - GDP Fluctuation

The South is one of the regions which contribute the most to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Brazil. However, due to the pandemic of COVID-19, the economy in the three states of the South has been much affected. Alice, a researcher of the University of the South, collected data on the GDP fluctuation in the whole South in each of the two last years. Each GDP fluctuation is represented by a percentage, in a manner that a positive percentage indicates growth in the corresponding period of one year, whilst a negative percentage indicates decrease.

Bob, a politician, is going to give an interview to the press tomorrow. Based on the two values collected by Alice, Bob wants to calculate the GDP fluctuation corresponding to the whole analysed period of two years, so he doesn't talk nonsense in the interview.

**Input**<br>
The input consists of two values **F<sub>1</sub>** and **F<sub>2</sub>** (-100.00 ≤ **F<sub>1</sub>**, **F<sub>2</sub>** ≤ 100.00), which correspond to the GDP fluctuations in the first and in the second years analysed by Alice, respectively. The values are given with exactly two digits after the decimal point.

**Output**<br>
Print a value, with exactly six digits after the decimal point, that corresponds to the GDP fluctuation in the whole analysed period of two years.
