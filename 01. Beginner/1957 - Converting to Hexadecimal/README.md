# 1957 - Converting to Hexadecimal

Data stored in computers are in binary. An economic way of visualizing these numbers is the usage of base 16 (hexadecimal).

Your task is to write a program that, given a natural number at base 10, shows its representation in hexadecimal.

**Input**<br>
The input is a positive integer number **V** at base 10 (1 ≤ **V** ≤ 2 x 10<sup>9</sup>).

**Output**<br>
The output is the same number **V** at base 16 in a single line (don't forget the end-of-line character). Use uppercase letters, as shown in the examples.
