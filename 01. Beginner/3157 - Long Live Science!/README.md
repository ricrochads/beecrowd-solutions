# 3157 - Long Live Science!

Oronob is a very peculiar boy. For him, only his opinion matters and nothing more. During the Coronavirus pandemic, he uses his opinion to retaliate what science says. He then, to boost his opinions, created a bot (robot that generates automatic messages) to trigger his texts to many people.

You know Oronob, but unlike him, you are sensible and you know that science is not refuted with opinion, as well as understanding programming, so you decided to hack Oronob's bot to avoid its fallacies.

Well, then create an algorithm that changes the text of Oronob's opinions to the real truth.

**Input**<br>
An **S** text with alphanumeric characters and possible spaces between words.

Limits: 0 <| **S** | <= 280.

**Output**<br>
The truth.
