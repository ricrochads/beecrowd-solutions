# 1177 - Array Fill II

Write a program that reads a number **T** and fill a vector **N**[1000] with the numbers from 0 to **T**-1 repeated times, like as the example below.

**Input**<br>
The input contains an integer number **T** (2 ≤ **T** ≤ 50).

**Output**<br>
For each position of the array **N**, print "**N[i] = x**", where **i** is the array position and **x** is the number stored in that position.

**Input Sample**
````
3
````          


**Output Sample**
````
N[0] = 0 
N[1] = 1 
N[2] = 2 
N[3] = 0 
N[4] = 1 
N[5] = 2 
N[6] = 0 
N[7] = 1
N[8] = 2
