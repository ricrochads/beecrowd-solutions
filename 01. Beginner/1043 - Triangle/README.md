# 1043 - Triangle

Read three point floating values (A, B and C) and verify if is possible to make a triangle with them. If it is possible, calculate the perimeter of the triangle and print the message:

Perimetro = XX.X

If it is not possible, calculate the area of the trapezium which basis A and B and C as height, and print the message:

Area = XX.X
