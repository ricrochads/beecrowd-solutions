# 3091 - Rest 1.0

John is a math student, but few people know that. One day, one of his classmates, thinking that John did not know basic math concepts, challenged him to perform a simple calculation: Calculate the remainder of the division of **A** รท **B**.

Since John is very shy and you are best friends, he informed you what the answer to the problem was and asked you to pass this information on to this colleague who challenged him. Can you do it?

Given two integers **A** and **B**, determine the remainder of the division of **A** รท **B** that John passed to you.

**Input**<br>
The input contains two integers **A** and **B** (1 <= **A**, **B** <= 100000).

**Output**<br>
The output contains a single integer, which is the remainder of the division of **A** รท **B**.
