# 1959 - Regular Simple Polygons

In Euclidean geometry, a regular polygon is a polygon that is equiangular (all angles are equal in measure) and equilateral (all sides have the same length). A simple polygon is one that does not intersect itself anywhere. Below we can see various mosaics made of regular polygons.

You must write a program that, given the number and the length of sides of a regular polygon, show its perimeter.

**Input**<br>
The input are two positive integers: **N** and **L**, which are, respectively, the number of sides and the length of each side of a regular polygon (3 ≤ **N** ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ **L** ≤ 4000).

**Output**<br>
The output is the perimeter **P** of the regular polygon in a single line.
